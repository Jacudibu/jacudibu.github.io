 In theory it should be possible to let the game be played by an AI in the background whilst the user is doing other stuff, which would be a cool background lighting mode. <br>
 I've created the Game during my Free Time in University, where we have an awesome Games Lab with all sorts of funny Hardware to fool around with. It was the first time I've created a game using my own Awkward Engine with C++ and SDL.
