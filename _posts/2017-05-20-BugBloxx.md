BugBloxx is the first Game I've worked on that got ever released on the App Store, yay!
It's a Block Puzzle game where you'll have to use all available Bugs in order to fill every field in the level. What makes it special, is that every Bug has a special Ability, depending on its surroundings. As an example, Grasshoppers will jump over Grass and Ants will call in more Ants when you place them close to an Anthill.

The first 30 levels are free, so there's really no excuse! :P


Since I've joined TheraBytes in December, I've mainly been working on the Mobile Port and general polishing until March, and then focused on creating new Levels and content for the first Update in May. I've also showcased the game at the Games Bavaria Vernissage 2017, which was lots of fun!
