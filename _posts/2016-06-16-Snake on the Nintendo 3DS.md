Snake is still a great game nowadays and my recent snake clone on the Roccat Keyboard wasn't enough. So as a next step, let's make one for the Nintendo 3DS. Yay!

If you want to give it a try, you can actually download it [here (there's both a 3ds Build and a Windows Executable)](https://github.com/Jacudibu/Snake2DS/releases/). I've also made a [post over at GBATemp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-snake2ds.431175/) about it. Have fun! :)
