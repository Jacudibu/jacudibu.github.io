You are trapped inside a Rubics Cube. In order to escape, you have to shoot with different NerfGuns and solve one side of the cube.

Rubic's Nerf was created during one Weekend at the Microsoft Uni(versi)ty Tour WS2015 where I've teamed up with some of my friends from Innoactive. There was no real theme given, so we've decided to try out that little idea we had some days ago.

My job during the jam was to implement the solving and rotation logic of the Cube, which worked out pretty fine after an all-nighter. :)
