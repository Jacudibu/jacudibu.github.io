	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<p>This is going to be my portfolio site!</p>

I had to move servers and since I've learned some frontend stuff I thought it would be nice to try out something different than prebuild wordpress plugins, therefore the site is currently kinda ... unavailable I guess. Sorry for the inconvenience, i'm on it (as soon as exams are over)!
