	<h1>Wow, how the hell did you get here?</h1>
	<p>
		Anyways, this site is still under construction and will receive some more love as soon as there are enough talks & Workshops to have a dedicated Page for them.
        <br>
		Still, here's a quick list to all those talks I've given:
        <br>
		<a href="/gitgood">Git Good</a>, at Semestergamejam 2017 (Summer)
        <br>
		Making games with LÃ¶ve, at Semestergamejam 2016 (Winter)
		<br>
		Unity VR Workshop at LMU (2016)
        <br>
