	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<p>This site is still under heavy construction!</p>
    <p><a href="/projects">While you are here, make sure to check out my projects!</a>

I had to move servers and since I've learned some frontend stuff I thought it would be nice to try out something different than prebuild wordpress plugins, therefore the site is currently kinda ... unavailable I guess. Sorry for the inconvenience, i'm on it!
