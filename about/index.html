	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<p>
		My Name is Stefan, or Jacudibu as i prefer to call myself in the Internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm currently studying Games Engineering at the Technische Universität München and work as a Game Developer at <a href = http://therabytes.de/>Therabytes</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the past I've also been working as VR Developer at <a href = http://innoactive.de>Innoactive</a> and as a Mobile QA Tester at <a href = https://www.ravensburger-digital.com/>Ravensburger Digital</a>. Other than that, I'm super interested in Software & Game Development and also do some 3DS Homebrew. I'll showcase most of my work on my Portofolio Site, so be sure to have a look at it!

		I'm not that much into social networks, though there should be some links at the bottom of this Page to those accounts I have and kinda try maintaining. Feel free to check them out if you want to contact me.
