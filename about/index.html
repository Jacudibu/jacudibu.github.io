	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<p>
		My Name is Stefan, or Jacudibu as i prefer to call myself in the Internet.

    <p>
		In the past I've been studying Games Engineering at the Technische Universität München and consider myself as a jack of all trades when it comes to development, with a special focus and passion on Backend, DevOps and Gameplay Programming.

		So far, I've been working as a Software Engineer over at <a href = http://maibornwolff.de>Maiborn Wolff</a>, as a Game Developer at <a href = http://therabytes.de/>Therabytes</a>, as a VR Developer at <a href = http://innoactive.de>Innoactive</a> and as a Mobile QA Tester at <a href = https://www.ravensburger-digital.com/>Ravensburger Digital</a>.

		Other than that, I'm super interested in Software & Game Development and also did some 3DS Homebrew in the past. I'll showcase most of my work on my Portofolio Site, so be sure to have a look at it!

		I'm not that much into social networks, though there should be some links at the bottom of this Page to those accounts I have and kinda try maintaining. Feel free to check them out if you want to contact or just follow me.
