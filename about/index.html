	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<p>
		My Name is Stefan, or Jacudibu as i call myself in the Internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm currently studying Games Engineering at the Technische Universität München and work as a VR Developer at <a href = http://innoactive.de> Innoactive </a>. In my spare time I love programming stupid things nobody needs (like this Awkward C++ Game Engine) or from time to time also small games, which you'll be able to find on this Site.

		I'm not that much into social networks, though there should be some links at the bottom of this Page to those accounts I kinda try maintaining. Feel free to check them out if you want to contact me.
